## Usage

Once you have installed the API generator, you can start creating your endpoints. Hereâ€™s how to use the tool effectively:

1. **Define Your Database Structure**: Create tables in your MariaDB or MySQL database.
2. **Generate the API**: Use the command line to generate your API endpoints.
   ```bash
   php generate.php

3. **Test Your API**: Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints.

## API Endpoints

The API supports various endpoints for CRUD operations:

- **Create**: POST request to create a new record.
- **Read**: GET request to retrieve records.
- **Update**: PUT request to update an existing record.
- **Delete**: DELETE request to remove a record.

### Example Requests

- **Create a Record**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe"}' http://yourapi.com/api/users
   ```

- **Read Records**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://yourapi.com/api/users
   ```

- **Update a Record**:
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Jane Doe"}' http://yourapi.com/api/users/1
   ```

- **Delete a Record**:
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://yourapi.com/api/users/1
   ```

## Configuration

To configure your API, modify the `config.php` file. You will need to set the following parameters:

- **Database Host**: Your database server address.
- **Database Name**: The name of your database.
- **Database User**: Your database username.
- **Database Password**: Your database password.

### Example Configuration

```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'your_database');
define('DB_USER', 'your_username');
define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');
```
